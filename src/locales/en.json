    "title": "About Me",
    "bio": "I'm Bulşah Keçici, based in Ankara, and I genuinely enjoy building things at the intersection of data science and software engineering. For over nine years, I've been working on AI-driven systems, and what keeps me excited is seeing complex data turn into something that actually helps people—something practical, usable, and meaningful in real life. When I face a new challenge, I like to slow down first: understand what the problem really is, where the data comes from, what's missing or misleading, and what decision someone is trying to make. Once the picture is clear, I build the solution step by step.\n\nMy work often revolves around machine learning, computer vision, and intelligent automation. I don't enjoy stopping at \"a model that works on my machine.\" I care about whether the system can be trusted, measured, maintained, and improved over time. That's why I naturally take ownership of the full journey—from data pipelines and feature building to model training, deployment, monitoring, and iteration. My statistical background helps me stay grounded and avoid shortcuts, while my engineering mindset helps me turn ideas into systems people can rely on.\n\nI work mostly with Python and SQL, and I'm comfortable using Docker, Kubernetes, and Git as part of everyday delivery. But for me, technology is never the goal—it's the tool that helps bring a thoughtful solution to life. I value collaboration, honest communication, and learning from others, and I enjoy working with teams where curiosity and responsibility go together. I'm especially motivated by opportunities that involve cross-border teamwork. That's why I'm open to roles across Germany and Europe, where I can help build intelligent systems that make data-driven decisions feel more human, more practical, and more impactful.",
