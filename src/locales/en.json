    "title": "About Me",
    "bio": "I'm Bulşah Keçici, a Data Scientist and Computer Engineer based in Ankara, Turkey, with over 9 years of experience in developing AI-driven analytical and automation systems. I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights through machine learning, computer vision, and intelligent process automation. My background combines statistical expertise and full-stack development, allowing me to design end-to-end AI solutions — from data processing pipelines to production-ready deployment. My work focuses on real-world problem-solving across infrastructure analytics, automation, and decision-support systems. I bridge the gap between research and implementation, using Python, SQL, and modern DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Git) to deliver scalable, measurable results. Passionate about innovation and cross-border collaboration, I'm open to opportunities in Germany and across Europe to build intelligent systems that shape the future of data-driven decision making.",
