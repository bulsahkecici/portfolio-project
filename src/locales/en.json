    "title": "About Me",
    "bio": "Hi, I'm Bulşah. I live in Ankara and I've been building AI systems for over 9 years. What I love most is taking messy data and turning it into something that actually works in the real world.\n\nWhen I start a new project, I first try to really understand the problem. Where does the data come from? What's missing? What are we actually trying to solve? Once I get that clear, I build the solution step by step.\n\nI work a lot with machine learning and computer vision. But I don't just build models—I make sure they work reliably, can be measured, and keep improving over time. I handle everything from data pipelines to deployment and monitoring. My background in statistics helps me think clearly, and my engineering side helps me turn ideas into real products.\n\nPython and SQL are my daily tools, along with Docker, Kubernetes, and Git. For me, tech is just a tool—the real goal is solving problems that matter.\n\nI also love traveling and meeting people from different cultures. There's something special about seeing how different places approach the same problems. It reminds me that the best solutions come from understanding the people behind the data.\n\nI'm open to working in Germany and across Europe. I enjoy international teams and learning from different perspectives on technology and innovation.",
